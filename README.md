Learning how to use Flask and deploy apps using Heroku.

Followed the steps in this article http://www.gtlambert.com/blog/deploy-flask-app-to-heroku to setup files for Heroku deploy. Had issues trying to deploy via the CLI (app doesn't fit requirements of heroku/python buildpack) so just manually deployed by connecting to GitHub repo in Heroku.

If you pull down the code, you can run the app on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ using:
```
py .\app.py
```
